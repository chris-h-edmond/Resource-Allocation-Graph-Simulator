Graphical Simulator for Resource Allocation Graphs
Overview
The project is a Graphical Simulator for Resource Allocation Graphs that can assist in visualizing process-resource interactions within an operating system. The simulator allows users to dynamically add, delete, and assign resources, identify deadlocks, and analyze system behavior in an interactive GUI-based environment.

Features
# Add & Remove Processes and Resources – Dynamically create and delete nodes.
# Request & Allocate Resources – Create and delete edges between processes and resources.
# Deadlock Detection – Detect and indicate deadlocks within the system.
# Real-time Graph Visualization – Visualize resource allocation through NetworkX and Matplotlib.
# Interactive GUI – Created with Tkinter for simple interaction
